# ACA-Project
It is the project for Advanced Computer Architecture exam where we try to optimize matrix multiplication and inversion using parallel computing.

## Files
- mat_mul.c: receives two files with a matrix in each one as argument and multiply them giving file with the result
- mat_inv.c: receives a file with a matrix as argument and calculates its inverse saving it in a file
- mat_gen.py: generates one or random matrix (depending on the number of the arguments) with a dimension specified as argument

mat_mul.c and mat_inv.c measure the time taken to perform the calculations.
